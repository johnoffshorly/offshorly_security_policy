# Offshorly Security Policy
**Version:** 0.1 | **Status:** Draft | **Review Cycle:** Monthly | **Date:** May 6, 2025

---

## Purpose

This document establishes Offshorly’s **Rolling Release Security Policy**, along with baseline security practices. It defines responsibilities, acceptable behaviors, and standards to protect company data, systems, and personnel from unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, and destruction.

---

## Rolling Release Definition

Offshorly’s security policy follows a **rolling release model**, meaning the policy is continuously reviewed, updated, and improved on a regular cycle (e.g., monthly). Unlike static policies, rolling release policies evolve over time to address:

- New security threats or vulnerabilities
- Changes in organizational structure or tools
- Improvements in best practices or legal requirements
- Additions of new security-related features, procedures, or technologies

All team members must comply with the current version and acknowledge updates as they are issued.

## Rolling Release Security Policy

### 1. Use of Official Company Emails
- Only Offshorly-issued email addresses must be used for account registration and access to all third-party services (e.g., GitHub, project tools, cloud platforms).
- Use of personal or external email addresses for work-related tools is strictly prohibited.

### 2. Credential and Password Storage
- Google Docs, Notion, or general-purpose documentation tools must not be used to store passwords or sensitive login credentials.
- All credentials must be stored in the designated, secure password manager (e.g., Vault).
- Access to the password manager must follow role-based access control and be periodically reviewed.

### 3. GitHub Repository Access
- Access to company GitHub repositories is only permitted through GitHub accounts registered under Offshorly email addresses.
- Repository access must be limited to authorized personnel only and reviewed monthly to remove inactive or outdated permissions.

### 4. Change Logging and Access Auditing
- All changes to sensitive systems must be logged and subject to audit.
- Regular monthly audits must be performed to review access to Vault, third-party apps, and code repositories.

### 5. Principle of Least Privilege
- Employees are granted the minimum level of access necessary to perform their responsibilities.
- Access rights are subject to review during onboarding, offboarding, and periodically as part of the rolling policy cycle.

### 6. Monthly Policy Review and Updates
- This policy will be updated at least once every 30 days.
- Changes may include revised procedures, added requirements, or new security controls.
- A changelog will be maintained, and employees must acknowledge new versions.
